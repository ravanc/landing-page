# Landing Page

Seeing the landing page that this project wanted its students to copy was what pushed me over the edge to commit to starting this project. To picture myself being able to do this page with barely any handholding felt good.

I always hated HTML and CSS because of how illogical things looked when I learnt it from other sources like CS50x or my past experiences with Codecademy. 

Thankfully I was able to reach this stage within a week of starting this project.

While the CSS is still verbose, I think it will be a design choice for myself not to factorise some of the styles such as color in `style.css` because it would make little difference changing the class of colors in the HTML compared to finding where the element is on the CSS based on its associated class.

All in all, satisfying that I was able to complete this whole landing page in about 2 - 2.5 hours.
